IBM mainframes sometimes used a variant of an SMS paddle card to connect power to peripherals. This design produces a card that can be used to build a replacement power paddle connector.

The material used with the IBM build SMS cards is somewhat fragile and is know to snap while the power connector is being inserted or removed. A new version using modern board materials is more rugged.

The typical PCB today is 1.6mm thick while the IBM slots are slightly thinner. Chamfering the back side of the connector thins it just enough to slide snugly into the SMS power socket. Alternatively, if a card can be specified at 1.56 mm thickness (unlikely) it would fit without any adjustment. 

These cards are used to connect the IBM 1627 plotter (rebadged Calcomp 565), the IBM 1054, 1055 and 1134 paper tape peripherals, the IBM 1053 keyboardless printer (Selectric based mechanism), and the internal 13SD disk drive into the IBM 1130.
